# Java-Pixel-Art-to-Color-Rectangles-Conversion-Tool
<p>Convert pixel art into multiple colored rectangles for Java... Why would you want this? I don't know.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project was to help out with my CS class project.</p>
<p>This project couldn't use sprite images, and result it led to this tool to ease the process.</p>
<p>To most, this is probably not useful but leading it published just in case.</p>
